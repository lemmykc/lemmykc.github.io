# Distilling SLT on LessWrong

Thanks to a grant from the [Long Term Future Fund](https://funds.effectivealtruism.org/funds/far-future), I am currently writing a sequence of posts on LessWrong that distills the very pure-mathematical Singular Learning Theory and translates the key lessons, claims and findings of my thesis into a more palatable format. The theory could go some way to helping the Alignment problem with potential applications in mechanistic interpretability. 

**Expected publish date:** Friday 16th June 2023

# Master's Thesis 

## [Phase Transitions in Neural Networks](http://therisingsea.org/notes/MSc-Carroll.pdf) 
**Supervisor:** [Dr. Daniel Murfet](http://therisingsea.org). <br>
**Date:** October 2021 <br>
**Summary:** The thesis studies Sumio Watanabe's _Singular Learning Theory_ (SLT) and explores how it can be used to explain why neural networks generalise so well, and how to think about and analyse phase transitions in deep learning. We illustrate some important aspects of Watanabeâ€™s theory for small neural networks by examining the relationship between singularities, phases and phase transitions. I demonstrate the existence of both first and second order phase transitions in the Bayesian posterior for simple ReLU neural networks by varying the true distribution.

You can find the code used to generate my Bayesian posterior experiments using HMC [here](https://github.com/lemmykc/phase-transitions-neural-networks).

In this talk I explain how to inerpret the phase transitions demonstrated in my thesis through the lens of Singular Learning Theory to an audience of fellow Master's students.
