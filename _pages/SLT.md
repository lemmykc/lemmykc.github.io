In October 2021, I completed my Master's Thesis 
[Phase Transitions in Neural Networks](http://therisingsea.org/notes/MSc-Carroll.pdf) under the supervision of [Dr. Daniel Murfet](http://therisingsea.org). 

The thesis studies Sumio Watanabe's _Singular Learning Theory_ (SLT) and explores how it can be used to explain why neural networks generalise so well, and how to think about and analyse phase transitions in deep learning, with toy examples of phase transitions in simple ReLU neural networks using MCMC methods. I am currently writing a sequence of posts on LessWrong that distills this very pure-mathematical theory and translates the key lessons, claims and findings of my thesis into a more palatable format. The theory could go some way to helping the Alignment problem with potential applications in mechanistic interpretability.
