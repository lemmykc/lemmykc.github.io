When words fail, music speaks. Angus Gray’s music spoke a million words. 

As a singer, producer, cellist, theatrical performer, one-man-rock-band, and at his core a pianist, Angus’ music touched and inspired so many of us in the St Leonard’s College community. Above all, he was a dearly beloved friend to myself and to many, many others. 

In May 2022, we were able to gather as a community to honour and celebrate Angus' extraordinary friendship, generosity of spirit, and musicianship, by doing the only thing that made sense: play music together. This memorial concert was directed by myself and Chris Burgess and was kindly supported by St Leonard's College.
