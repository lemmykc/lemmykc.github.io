I am a mathematician, musician, and hiker who is still figuring out how to summarise my interests into one clean sentence. 

I recently completed a Master's of Mathematics at The University of Melbourne, completing a thesis under the supervision of Dr. Daniel Murfet and Dr. Thomas Quella. 
The thesis, title [Phase Transitions in Neural Networks](http://therisingsea.org/notes/MSc-Carroll.pdf), aimed to distill Sumio Watanabe's _Singular Learning Theory_ (SLT) and explore how it can be used to explain why neural networks generalise so well. 

Prior to that I completed a Diploma of Music in Clarinet performance, and I thoroughly enjoy conducting. I am deeply passionate about making Australian classical music more relevant and engaging for the audience it seeks to serve, by transforming _what_ we play and _how_ it is played. 

In 2022/23, I have been a hiking guide on the 6-day Overland Track with Tasmanian Walking Company. It has been an immense privilege to traverse this parallel universe over 12 times in the past 12 months.

I love this picture! And [this document]({{ site.url }}/uni_assignments/Lie_Algebras_Assignment_1_FINAL.pdf) is awesome.
