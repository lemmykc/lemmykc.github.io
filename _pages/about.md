I am a mathematician, musician, and hiker. Intuitively, these things feel deeply interconnected to me, though many people are surprised at how orthogonal these interests seemingly are. At the very least, they each fill me with joy through a combination of beauty, love and wildness. 


I recently studied a Master's of Mathematics at The University of Melbourne, completing a thesis on [Phase Transitions in Neural Networks](http://therisingsea.org/notes/MSc-Carroll.pdf), under the supervision of Dr. Daniel Murfet. The thesis studies Sumio Watanabe's _Singular Learning Theory_ (SLT) and explores how it can be used to explain why neural networks generalise so well, and how to think about and analyse phase transitions in deep learning, with toy examples of phase transitions in simple ReLU neural networks using MCMC methods. I am currently writing a sequence of posts on LessWrong that distills this very pure-mathematical theory and translates the key lessons, claims and findings of my thesis into a more palatable format. The theory could go some way to helping the Alignment problem with potential applications in mechanistic interpretability. 

I have also completed a Diploma of Music in Clarinet performance, and I thoroughly enjoy conducting. I am deeply passionate about making Australian classical music more relevant and engaging for the audience it seeks to serve, by transforming _what_ we play and _how_ it is played, in service of a more connected community and sense of identity. 

In 2022/23, I have been a lead hiking guide on the 6-day Overland Track with Tasmanian Walking Company. It has been an immense privilege to traverse this parallel universe over 16 times in the past 12 months. Between this work and other recreational trips, I spent about 125 days in the last 15 months in wilderness (as of June 2023).

I love this picture! And [this document](assets/pdf/uni_assignments/Lie_Algebras_Assignment_1_FINAL.pdf) is awesome.
