I am a mathematician, musician, and hiker. Intuitively, these things feel deeply interconnected to me, though many people are surprised at how orthogonal these interests seemingly are. At the very least, they each fill me with joy through a combination of beauty, love and wildness. 


I recently studied a Master's of Mathematics at The University of Melbourne, completing a thesis on [Phase Transitions in Neural Networks](http://therisingsea.org/notes/MSc-Carroll.pdf), under the supervision of Dr. Daniel Murfet which explained the key messages of Sumio Watanabe's Singular Learning Theory. You can read more about my work [here](/mathematics/SLT/).

I have also completed a Diploma of Music in Clarinet performance, and I thoroughly enjoy conducting. I am deeply passionate about making Australian classical music more relevant and engaging for the audience it seeks to serve, by transforming _what_ we play and _how_ it is played, in service of a more connected community and sense of identity. 

In 2022/23, I have been a lead hiking guide on the 6-day Overland Track with Tasmanian Walking Company. It has been an immense privilege to traverse this parallel universe over 16 times in the past 12 months. Between this work and other recreational trips, I spent over 120 days in wilderness in 2022/23.
