# Assignments

Here are the set of assignments I completed across the course of my Masters
degree. In completing these assignments I was greatly assisted by the work 
of those that had come before me, so I figure it is only fair to share my work
on the off chance somebody else may find something useful in there. 

Of course, not everything was 100% correct all of the time, and I am not 
willing to share the feedback my professors gave me along the journey. 
In other words: buyer beware. Refer to these at your own discretion. Use them
for inspiration instead of answers. Besides, thats how most mathematics is learned, 
right? You get some assistance on the essence of the proof, and then do the 
hard work of proving it yourself.
