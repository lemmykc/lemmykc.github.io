Since March 2022, I have had the immense privilege of being a guide for the Tasmnaian Walking Company on the Overland Track, a place I truly consider to be the most magical on earth. This photo was taken just before I descended off of Mt Ossa, Tasmania's rooftop, for the final time in a while as I bring this chapter to a close (for now). 

Sitting at Kia Ora hut that night, I looked at this photo and felt both awed and overwhelmed. I saw a deep comfort in myself, my guiding, and most importantly, in this place, on this Palawa land called lutruwita. This wilderness is now a form of home to me. At the same time, spending so much time in the ancient old growth forests, the expansive buttongrass plains, and the dramatic dolerite mountains, you sense that we are all merely guests here. 

I feel incredible gratitude to all of those I met across my 16 journeys into the wilderness for sharing their laughs, lessons, hearts and joys with me. This is an experience that will live with me forever, and I will absolutely be back.
