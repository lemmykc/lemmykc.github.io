title: Completed Master's Thesis on _Phase Transitions in Neural Networks_

On just about the last day of Melbourne's final pandemic lockdown, I completed my Master's Thesis 
[Phase Transitions in Neural Networks](http://therisingsea.org/notes/MSc-Carroll.pdf) under the supervision of [Dr. Daniel Murfet](http://therisingsea.org).
